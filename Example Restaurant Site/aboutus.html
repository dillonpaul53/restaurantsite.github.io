<p>The Friendly Antler is owned and operated by myself, Dillon Rodgers, local Estes Park resident for 20 years and personal fan and promoter of homestyle meals. In this past year, our team here has done our absolute best to reach out and develop a relationship with the locals. We have also been trying to spread the word to bring in new guests from all over the world. We try and embody the kind and old-fashioned spirit of our home town, while expressing the spirit of the greater Southwest region.</p>
<p>So whether you are craving hearty biscuits and gravy, spicy huevos rancheros, or a juicy hamburger, we have the food to satisfy whatever you may be craving. Our staff is experienced and compassionate about what they do. Our local talent can help advise you on all the happenings and attractions of Estes Park. After all, as important as it is to us that you enjoy the Friendly Antler, we would also love you to enjoy the rest of your time spent here in our beautiful city.</p>
<p>Come check us out at 447 Elkhorn Ave., located in the middle of downtown. Worry not about how busy it may seem outside our doors we have plenty of seating to accommodate any size group, and we do accept reservations for dinner time. Our customers are our world, so feel free to contact us or write a review.</p>
<p>Although we work hard and do our very best for our guests, we here at The Friendly Antler believe there is always room for improvement. So, with your help we strive to make Estes Park's best homestyle restaurant better and better with every passing day. We whole heartedly love and thank our loyal customers, and for those who have never been to our humble cafe, we encourage to you stop by to enjoy some great food with some friendly faces.</p>
