<p>This is our restaurant, The Friendly Antler. We are located in the beautiful and historic town of Estes Park, Colorado. We serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with a focus around homestyle favorites and south of the border inspirations. If you would like to grab coffee with a friend, plan a family dinner, or start your morning routine off right, the Friendly Antler is the perfect restaurant for any outing.</p>
<p>We can seat up to 120 people in the restaurant, but booth style seating in the front rooms makes small groups feel at home as well. Whether it is the dead of winter or the peak of festival season, we can accommodate many people, but never at the cost of our impeccable service. We serve beer and wine for those looking to lighten up the day; this of course includes champagne for that early morning mimosas. The Friendly Antler is a symbol for our number one rule here, make everyone feel as if they are a local to this beautiful little town of ours.</p>
